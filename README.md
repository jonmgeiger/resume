# Jon Geiger's Semi-Modular Resume

This project aims to make the process of creating tailored resumes more streamlined. With so many job applications to submit, so many companies ask for different requirements. By making each component of the resume a different part to a whole, it becomes much easier to edit the document to incorporate different skills and experiences to avoid wasting the time of those who look over the document.
